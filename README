I have written a program in Python that can predict the goal difference required for a team to finish in a certain position based on data from the last 24 years of EPL Football
I used the concept of Regression analysis linear regression to predict and build the model of English Premier league (football)
Goal difference is the difference between Goals scored and goals conceded by a team, in a match. 
Though the column doesn't exist I added it myself into the dataset
